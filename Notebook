Monday July 3,
  X Drill down on the data presented in Angeletti
    * I plan on doing this daily until it sticks
  X Ran down the examples of B cell competition in lit review
    * Actually not that much, a lot of homogenous B cell population models
    * More Ab-B cell competition to be honest
  X Implement Logistic Growth in R
    X Find ODE solver that works well
    X Implement 1 var
    X Implement 2 var
    X get ggplot2 and make it work
    - try and abstract the code to N competing populations?
      * This ended up being really hard, I'm going to work on it tomorrow
