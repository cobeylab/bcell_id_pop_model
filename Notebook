Monday July 3,
  - Drilled down on the data presented in Angeletti
    - I plan on doing this daily until it sticks
  - Ran down the examples of B cell competition in lit review
    - Actually not that much, a lot of homogenous B cell population models
    - More Ab-B cell competition to be honest
  - Implementing Logistic Growth in R
    - Found ODE solver that works well
    - Implemented 1 var
    - Implemented 2 var
    * get ggplot2 and make it work
    * try and abstract the code to N competing populations?
